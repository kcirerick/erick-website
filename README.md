<h1>Erick's Website</h1>
<p>Hello, welcome to my first and only personal website. For this site, I will be using the _s theme for wordpress and buildling off of this source code to create my own custom, personal wordpress website. Through this, I hope to become more proficient at using the following languages, frameworks, and skills. <p>
<ul>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>CSS</li>
	<li>JS/JSX (in case of React</li>
	<li>React (?)</li>
	<li>PHP</li>
	<li>Wordpress</li> 
	<li>Website Design</li>
	<li>Project Deployment</li>
	<li>Sketch</li>
	<li>Any other skills I may end up needing or using along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also hope that this will become a creative outlet for myself and hope to produce a project that I'm both proud of and enjoyed making. I also think it sounds pretty cool to say I have my own website.
